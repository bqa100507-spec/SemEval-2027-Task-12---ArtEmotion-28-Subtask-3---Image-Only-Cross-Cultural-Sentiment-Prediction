# Project state

| Component | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Public dataset | Pinned ST3 checkout and local integrity audit complete |
| Baseline | Full CUDA development run complete. Cached rerun byte-identical. CPU embedding smoke passed |
| Local evaluation | 0.446564 Contrast and 0.751995 macro Log Loss for CLIP + LR |
| Submission | `runs/baseline_dev/submission.zip` validated against all 849 public development keys |
| Tests | 26 lightweight tests passed locally. GitHub Actions workflow included |

Run `py scripts/setup.py` on Windows, then use the virtual environment for `scripts/run_st3.py baseline`, `scripts/run_st3.py submission`, `scripts/run_st3.py validate runs/baseline_dev/submission.zip`, and `python -m pytest -q`. See the [README](../README.md) for executable paths and standalone audit and evaluation commands.

The experiment uses the pinned public development split and a sparse representation of the official features. See the [data audit](../reports/data_audit.md) for coverage and [baseline report](../reports/baseline_dev.md) for measured scores and reproducibility checks.

Pending work includes reviewing the setup branch and uploading the development archive manually if desired. The first follow-up experiment is the organizers' shared-image-weights ablation. Keep the data, image embeddings, `C` and scoring fixed, and remove only the image-language interaction block. Report paired per-painting Contrast changes and per-language Log Loss alongside the aggregate scores.
